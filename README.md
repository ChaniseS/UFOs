# UFO Findings with JavaScript
## Overview of the Analysis:
This analysis is based on expanding the webpage data created in this Module. This challenge allowed us to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
## Results:
The UFO Findings webpage is New Improved both Visually and Functionally. 
Not only can you Filter by Date but now with a few modifications to the Code, we now have the ability to Filter by City, State, Country, and Shape.

## Conclusion:
Although this webpage seems to be user friendly, there are some things that could be added/updated:
- The "Type-in" method, might be a little difficult for users to grasp. If a user types in "CA" instead of "ca", there are no results returned so they User may think there is no data for the State of "ca".
For this reason, I think a dropdown menu might be more feasiable and even more user friendly. 
- Maybe we should incorporate a "Search" button. Unless the user really pays attention to the table, there is not indication that the table loaded and the filter is working.
